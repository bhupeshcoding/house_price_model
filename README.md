# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple **machine learning workflow** using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various features (like crime rate, number of rooms, distance to employment centers, etc.).

It uses the **Boston Housing dataset** and runs entirely in **Google Colab** or any Python environment.

## 📌 Features

- Loads real-world housing data
- Trains a linear regression model
- Predicts house prices
- Evaluates model performance
- Visualizes predictions vs. actual values

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run this notebook directly in **Google Colab** with zero setup.

### 🔗 Open in Colab
